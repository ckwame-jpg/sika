# Paper Parlay Builder — Scope

**Author**: drafted 2026-05-17 (Batch B of the trade-desk UX session).
**Status**: scope only — not yet started.
**Estimated effort**: ~half a day if no surprises.

## Problem

Operators today can only **observe** model-recommended parlays via the read-only
`Parlay Predictions` ledger. There is no UI to:

1. Hand-pick legs from the trade desk (e.g. "Duren 10+ pts AND Mitchell 25+ pts")
2. See the combined model probability + correlation lift in real time
3. Save the combination as a paper parlay and watch it settle in the portfolio

Singles already have this loop: pick → paper trade button → portfolio settles
the outcome. Parlays do not. This blocks the operator from testing parlay
strategies the same way they test single picks.

## Out of scope (deliberately)

- **Demo parlays via Kalshi sandbox** — Kalshi's API doesn't expose a parlay
  endpoint; sandbox orders are per-ticker. Paper-only for v1.
- **"Trade on Kalshi" for parlays** — same reason; would need a guided "place
  each leg yourself" flow. Defer to v2 if ever.
- **Parlay editing after creation** — paper parlay is immutable once saved
  (matches paper-position semantics).
- **Cross-event parlays with > 6 legs** — backend `parlay_max_output` caps the
  recommendation combiner at 4–5 legs today; the builder mirrors that cap.
- **Real-time recalculation across stale cards** — if a leg's underlying market
  closes mid-build, the build fails on submit rather than silently dropping a
  leg. (Out of scope to live-recompute as cards age.)

## UX flow

1. **Entry point**: a new "Add to parlay" button next to "paper trade" on
   the trade-ticket card.
2. **Tray**: clicking the button adds the current selection to a persistent
   tray that docks at the bottom of the trade-desk page. Tray shows each leg
   as a chip (player + threshold + side + entry price).
3. **Live joint math**: as legs are added, the tray header recomputes:
   - Combined market price (product of entry prices)
   - Combined model probability (correlation-adjusted; reuse `_compute_joint_probability` from `parlays.py:232`)
   - Implied edge
   - American odds string (reuse the existing formatter)
4. **Submit**: a "Save paper parlay" button on the tray. Opens a small modal
   with: stake amount, optional notes, confirm. Submits to a new POST
   `/paper-parlays` endpoint.
5. **Portfolio surface**: paper parlays render in a new collapsible section in
   `/positions`, below the existing paper positions table. Same column shape as
   the predictions ledger (leg count, sport scope, joint price, joint prob,
   odds, edge, status, realized pnl) plus the operator's stake + notes.
6. **Settlement**: when the underlying single predictions for every leg
   settle, the paper parlay's outcome is rolled up using the same logic as
   `_settle_parlay_rows` in `parlays.py:657` (any loss → lost; all won → won;
   any push/cancelled → cancelled).

## Data model

**New table**: `paper_parlay` (mirrors `parlay_prediction` shape minus the
recommendation lineage):

**Alembic migration**: one revision adding both tables + indexes on
`(settlement_status, created_at)` and `(paper_parlay_id, leg_index)`.

## Backend changes

1. **Schema** (`apps/api/app/schemas.py`):
   - `PaperParlayCreate` — list of leg specs (ticker, side, entry_price snapshot) + stake + notes
   - `PaperParlayLegRead` — wire shape of one leg
   - `PaperParlayRead` — wire shape of full parlay
2. **Service** (`apps/api/app/services/paper_parlays.py` — new):
   - `create_paper_parlay(db, payload)` — validates each leg's ticker against active markets, resolves `source_prediction_id` from the latest unsettled prediction for that ticker+side, computes joint prob via the existing `_compute_joint_probability`, persists to `paper_parlay` + `paper_parlay_leg` atomically
   - `settle_paper_parlays(db)` — mirrors `settle_parlay_predictions` but on the new tables; runs from the same cron entry that does prediction + parlay-prediction settlement
3. **Endpoints** (`apps/api/app/api/routes.py`):
   - `POST /paper-parlays` — create
   - `GET /paper-parlays` — list (filter by status)
   - The existing `GET /positions` aggregator returns paper parlays in a new `paper_parlays` field alongside `paper_positions`
4. **Settlement wiring**: add `settle_paper_parlays` to the post-settlement
   chain in `refresh_jobs.py` so paper parlays settle on the same tick as
   prediction parlays.

## Frontend changes

1. **Tray** (`apps/web/components/trade/parlay-tray.tsx` — new):
   - Zustand store (lightweight) holding `legs: TradeSelection[]`
   - Render docked at bottom of trade-desk page when length > 0
   - Live joint math via a `usePaperParlayQuote(legs)` hook that posts to a
     new `POST /paper-parlays/quote` endpoint (or computes client-side
     using a published `correlationFactors` constant — backend call is more
     authoritative)
2. **Trade-ticket button** (`apps/web/components/trade/trade-ticket.tsx`):
   - "Add to parlay" pill next to "paper trade"; disabled when the current
     selection is already in the tray or when the leg count would exceed 5
3. **Save dialog** (extend `apps/web/components/positions/trade-dialog.tsx`
   or add a parallel `paper-parlay-dialog.tsx`):
   - Stake input, notes textarea, confirm → POST `/paper-parlays` → clear tray
     → push toast → invalidate `/positions` SWR key
4. **Portfolio section** (`apps/web/components/positions/paper-parlays-table.tsx` — new):
   - Mirror `paper-positions-table.tsx` shape; expandable rows show each leg
5. **Routing**: no new route — paper parlays live on `/positions`

## Test plan

**Backend (pytest)**:
- `test_create_paper_parlay_resolves_source_predictions` — given valid leg tickers, the created parlay's legs link to the latest unsettled prediction per leg
- `test_create_paper_parlay_rejects_closed_markets` — at least one leg's market is closed → 400
- `test_create_paper_parlay_joint_probability_matches_combiner` — same input as the predictions combiner produces same joint prob (reuse fixture)
- `test_settle_paper_parlays_wins_when_all_legs_won` — three settled legs all WIN → outcome=won, realized_pnl computed
- `test_settle_paper_parlays_loses_on_any_loss` — three legs, one LOST → outcome=lost
- `test_settle_paper_parlays_cancels_on_push` — any leg PUSH/CANCELLED → outcome=cancelled (matches existing parlay-prediction semantics)
- `test_settle_paper_parlays_skips_pending` — any leg still pending → outcome stays pending

**Frontend (vitest)**:
- `parlay-tray.test.tsx` — adding/removing legs updates the tray; joint math
  fetches and displays; cap at 5 legs is enforced
- `paper-parlay-dialog.test.tsx` — stake validation, submit fires correct
  POST body, clear-tray-on-success
- `paper-parlays-table.test.tsx` — renders settled/pending parlays with
  correct color coding; expand toggle shows legs

**E2E (playwright)** — one happy path:
- Operator picks 2 player props → adds both to tray → joint math appears →
  saves parlay → navigates to /positions → sees the row → simulates leg
  settlement → row updates to "won" with realized_pnl.

## Open questions for the operator

1. **Stake denomination**: are paper parlays denominated in dollars (fake) or
   contract units? Paper positions use `quantity * entry_price` semantics —
   should parlays match (`stake = quantity * combined_price`) or be a
   freeform dollar amount? **Recommendation**: dollar amount, since the
   typical parlay UX (DraftKings/FanDuel) takes a dollar wager.
2. **Tray persistence across page reloads**: should the tray persist in
   localStorage? **Recommendation**: yes — losing 4 legs of work on a tab
   refresh is awful.
3. **Edit a leg's entry price**: when a leg's market price has moved since
   the operator first added it to the tray, do we re-snapshot on save or
   warn? **Recommendation**: warn and let the operator re-pick if they care;
   default to "save with current market price."
4. **Correlation explanation**: should the tray surface WHY the joint
   probability lifted (e.g. "+4% from shared subject")? **Recommendation**:
   v1 ship without; v2 add a tooltip on the joint-prob number.

## Phasing

**Phase 1 (MVP, ship together)** — everything in this scope.
**Phase 2 (deferred)** — correlation lift breakdown, parlay-builder via API
(no UI), Kalshi sandbox parlay route once Kalshi exposes one.

## Implementation order (when you're ready to build)

1. Backend models + alembic migration (no service code yet)
2. Backend service `create_paper_parlay` + tests (no endpoints)
3. Backend POST endpoint + tests
4. Backend settlement extension + tests
5. Frontend tray store + render + tests
6. Frontend dialog + POST integration + tests
7. Frontend portfolio table + tests
8. E2E happy path
9. Wire into refresh_jobs.py cron chain

Each step should be a separately-mergeable commit so codex can review each
piece in isolation per the standard sika review pattern.
